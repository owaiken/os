# Archon Project Summary

## Overview
This project focused on configuring and improving the Archon AI agent platform with a focus on:
- Setting up OpenRouter for multiple LLM models
- Configuring OpenAI for embeddings
- Implementing secure license activation
- Ensuring robust security practices

## Key Accomplishments

### API Configuration
- Successfully configured OpenRouter for LLM functionality
- Set up OpenAI API for embeddings
- Implemented proper environment variable management

### License Management
- Fixed license validation issues in cloud environments
- Improved error handling and diagnostics
- Successfully activated license on Render

### Security Enhancements
- Implemented secure logging with redaction of sensitive information
- Added input validation for URLs and other user inputs
- Created secure database operations with SQL injection prevention
- Implemented comprehensive RLS policies for database tables
- Added proper error handling to prevent information disclosure

### Environment Configuration
- Set up proper environment variables in Render
- Configured Supabase connection
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for credential management

## Environment Variables
The following environment variables are required:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for embeddings
- `LLM_API_KEY`: OpenRouter API key for LLM models
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`: Supabase service key
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anon key
- `KEYGEN_ACCOUNT_ID`: Keygen account ID
- `KEYGEN_PRODUCT_ID`: Keygen product ID
- `BASE_URL`: OpenRouter API URL
- `PRIMARY_MODEL`: Primary LLM model
- `REASONER_MODEL`: Reasoning LLM model
- `TEMPORARY_DEPLOYMENT`: Set to 1 for cloud deployments

## Next Steps
For future development, consider:
1. Moving to a more modern architecture with Next.js/React frontend
2. Integrating with n8n for workflow automation
3. Exploring OpenWebUI as an alternative platform
4. Implementing a more scalable, service-oriented architecture

## Lessons Learned
- Streamlit has limitations for production-grade web applications
- Cloud deployments require special handling for license management
- Proper separation of concerns improves maintainability and security
- Modern web frameworks offer better UI/UX capabilities

## Repository Structure
Key files and directories:
- `utils/license_manager.py`: License validation and management
- `utils/utils.py`: Core utility functions including API client initialization
- `fix_render_startup.py`: Environment setup and validation
- `render.yaml`: Render deployment configuration
